Queue:
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
It is an abstract data type that represents a collection of elements with two main operations:
enqueue and dequeue

The other operations can be : check if full/empty,
							  count the number of elements, 
							  display elements.

a queue can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
