ADT is short for Abstract Data Types

it is used to refer to stack, Heap, Queue, Linked List

When we say we need to use the "stack" ADT for this program. we are talking in general terms
e.g. 
in C++ a dynamic array is made using a "Vector" keyword while the same thing in C# is done using the "List" keyword.
